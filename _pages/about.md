About Me
======
My name is Luyang Fang, and I am a PhD student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Georgia. I am currently working in the Big Data Analytics Lab, supervised by Professor [Ping Ma](https://bdalpingio.github.io/) and Professor [Wenxuan Zhong](https://zhonglabuga.github.io/). I received my Master's degree in Statistics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2021. My research interests include deep learning, large language models (LLMs), nonparametric modeling, big data analytics, bioinformatics, and AI-enhanced educational assessment.


*News: I am actively seeking tenure-track Assistant Professor positions in Statistics/AI and related fields.*
